# Modal with phone number input - recruitment task

## Start the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Thoughts
In production enviroment I would:
- add validation for input
- change behavior of closing selector, right now it's preaty primitive
- react separate space for holding types
